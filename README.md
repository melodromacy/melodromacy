Further info is in my Strawpage including my DNI.

I am currently being lolcowed by two people on PonyTown who are actively fakeclaiming me and claiming that I'm ableist for using 'meltdown' (note: I am autistic and do experience meltdowns myself) to refer to someone having a tantrum. If you are known to interact with TrickOrSqueak or Frankie (holeintheattic), you will be blocked. I am being lolcowed because of my mental illnesses and my bad grasp on reality; I have serious unreality issues and struggle with several unmanaged and unmedicated mental illnesses. They are actively cyberstalking me and slandering me to people over a year after the initial incidents - in some cases, some of the things I was sent by either Frankie or someone directly related - happened to be real life gore and mutilated dead bodies. I have had hate art sent to me five times because of this.

Many of my alters appear to be 'problematic' to people, but I do not control who I form or who we are. Many of us aren't even "the character", but rather just the same in appearance or name only.

Please, just be kind.
