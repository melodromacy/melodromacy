Further info is in my Strawpage including my DNI.

I am currently being lolcowed by two people on PonyTown who are actively fakeclaiming me and claiming that I'm ableist for using 'meltdown' (note: I am autistic and do experience meltdowns myself) to refer to someone having a tantrum. If you are known to interact with TrickOrSqueak, or Frankie (holeintheattic), you will be blocked. I am being lolcowed because of my mental illnesses and my bad grasp on reality; I have serious unreality issues and struggle with several unmanaged and unmedicated mental illnesses. They are actively cyberstalking me and slandering me to people over a year after the initial incidents - in some cases, some of the things I was sent by either Frankie or someone directly related - happened to be real life gore and mutilated dead bodies. I have had hate art sent to me five times because of this.

Many of the alters in this system appear to be 'problematic' to people, but I do not control who we form or who we are. Many of us aren't even "the character", but rather just the same in appearance or name only. Please, don't make assumptions about us because of our perceived sources; we just want to have a place to talk and feel connected to people.

I hide Project Moon (Limbus / L. Corporation) skins for personal comfort. I block/hide freely, it's not a condemnation of you personally. I often hide for things like an uncomfortable subject or because of 'humping' other ponies or even just for spam advertising.

I'm sorry if my reaction to getting triggered by something bothers people. Yes, I did hide them as fast as I possibly could. Yes, I am still allowed to be upset because of the trigger itself. It's not as simple as "hide and move on" when I can be affected by a trigger for hours. I'm sorry if it bothers others; it's a kneejerk reaction and I don't control it.

Please, just be kind.
